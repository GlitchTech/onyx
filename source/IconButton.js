/**
	_onyx.IconButton_ is an icon that acts like a button. The icon image is
	specified by setting the _src_ property to a URL.

	If you want to combine an icon with text inside a button, use an
	[onyx.Icon](#onyx.Icon) inside an [onyx.Button](#onyx.Button).

	The image associated with the _src_ property of the IconButton is assumed
	to be 32x64-pixel strip with the top half showing the button's normal state
	and the bottom half showing its state when hovered-over or active.

	For more information, see the documentation on
	[Buttons](building-apps/controls/buttons.html) in the Enyo Developer Guide.
